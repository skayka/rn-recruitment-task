# Recruitment task

Hi. Thank you for taking your time and reviewing this recruitment task.

I have done two different implementations:  
[RTK-QUERY branch](https://github.com/skayka/rn-recruitment-task/tree/RTK-query)  
[OVERKILL branch](https://github.com/skayka/rn-recruitment-task/tree/overkill)

# Further improvements TBD

1. add loading skeleton instead of generic `loading` screen
2. design improvements (currently the design from the task was implemented)
3. using .env for config
4. UX improvement of TextSearch component
5. removing the limit on pokemonId, so any pokemon could be loaded with images from the api
6. adding tests
